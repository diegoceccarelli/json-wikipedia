The '''Royal Thai Armed Forces''' ({{lang-th|กองทัพไทย}}; {{RTGS|Kong Thap Thai}}) is the name of the [[military]] of the [[Kingdom of Thailand]]. It consists of the following branches:
* '''[[Royal Thai Army]]''' (กองทัพบกไทย)
* '''[[Royal Thai Navy]]''' (กองทัพเรือไทย, ราชนาวีไทย)
**[[Royal Thai Marine Corps]] (นาวิกโยธินไทย)
* '''[[Royal Thai Air Force]]''' (กองทัพอากาศไทย)
*Other [[Paramilitary]] Forces

Created in 1852, the Royal Thai Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force in order to thwart any western threat and any attempts at colonialization. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. However the office of ''Kalahom'' and the military of Siam had existed since the days of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in the 13th Century.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

As of 2013, the Royal Thai Armed Forces had 306,000 active duty personnel.<ref name="GF Active Duty">{{cite web|title=Active Military Manpower by Country|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/active-military-manpower.asp|website=Global Firepower|publisher=Global Firepower|accessdate=2014-10-16}}</ref> The Thai military has more than 1,750 flag officers (generals and admirals), a bloated number for a military of its size.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=John|last2=Sciacchitano|first2=Steve|title=Thai army: new line-up, same fault-lines|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-011013.html|accessdate=4 Apr 2015|work=Asia Times|date=2013-10-01}}</ref> On 2 May 2015  1,043 new flag officers of all three services promoted in 2014-2015 took the oath of allegiance.<ref>{{cite news|title=New generals take oath before the Crown Prince|url=http://thainews.prd.go.th/CenterWeb/NewsEN/NewsDetail?NT01_NewsID=WNROY5805030010001|accessdate=3 May 2015|agency=National News Bureau of Thailand (NNT)|date=2015-05-03}}</ref> It is not clear how many retired during the same period.

Those chosen randomly are subjected to twenty-four months full-time service, while volunteers are subjected to eighteen months service, depending on their education.

The [[Public holidays in Thailand|Royal Thai Armed Forces Day]] is celebrated on January 18 to commemorate the victory of King [[Naresuan the Great]] in battle against the [[Mingyi Swa|Crown Prince]] of [[Toungoo dynasty|Burma]] in 1593.

==Role==
The Royal Thai Armed Forces main role is the protection of the [[sovereignty]] and [[territorial integrity]] of the Kingdom of Thailand. The armed forces are also charged with the defence of the [[monarchy of Thailand]] against all threats both foreign and domestic.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090418003625/http://www.schq.mi.th/EN/vision_mission.htm Vision]. schq.mi.th</ref>

Apart from these roles, the armed forces also have responsibilities ensuring public order and participating in social development programs by aiding the [[Government of Thailand|civilian government]]. The armed forces are also charged with assisting victims of national disasters and drug control.

In recent years the Royal Thai Armed Forces have begun increasing its role on the international stage by providing [[peacekeeping]] forces to the [[United Nations]] (UN), in the [[International Force for East Timor]] (INTERFET), from 1999 to 2002.<ref name="un.org">[http://www.un.org/peace/etimor/UntaetF.htm UNTAET].

==History==
{{main|Military history of Thailand}}

===Conflicts===
The Royal Thai Armed Forces was involved in many conflicts throughout its history, including global, regional and internal conflicts. However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only two foreign incursions into Thai territory were in December 1941, when the Empire of [[Japan]] [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded]] and then [[Japanese occupation of Thailand|occupied]] the country, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].

*'''[[Franco-Siamese War]]''' (1893)
*: With the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash]. nationmultimedia.com.

*'''[[World War I]]''' (1917–1918)
*: King [[Vajiravudh]] on the 22 of July 1917 decided to declare war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He sent a volunteer corps, the [[Siam during World War I|Siamese Expeditionary Force]], composed of 1,233 modern-equipped and trained men commanded by Field Marshal Prince [[Chakrabongse Bhuvanath]]. The Force included air and medical personnel, the medical units actually seeing combat. Siam became the only independent [[Asia]]n nation with forces in [[Europe]] during the Great War. Although Siam’s participation militarily was minimal, it enabled the revision or complete cancellation of [[unequal treaties]] with the [[United States]], [[France]] and the [[British Empire]].<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/features/thailand.htm Feature Articles – Thailand and the First World War].

*'''[[Franco-Thai War]]''' (1940–1941)
*:The Franco-Thai War began in October 1940, when the country under the rule of Field Marshal [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] followed up border clashes by invading a French Indo-China, under the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] (after the [[Nazi]] occupation of Paris) to regain lost land and settle territorial disputes. The war also bolstered Phibun’s program of promoting Thai nationalism.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/thailandwwii/nationalism.html&date=2009-10-25+22:47:39 Nation-building and the Pursuit of Nationalism under Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]</ref> The war ended indecisively, with Thai victories on land and a naval defeat at sea. However, the disputed territories in French Indochina were ceded to Thailand.

*'''[[World War II]]''' (1942–1945)
{{main|Thailand in World War II}}
*:In order to attack [[British India]], [[British Burma]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]], the Japanese Empire needed to use bases in Thailand. By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] of Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The Thai forces resisted, but were soon being overwhelmed. By 07:30 am, a frightened Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the Empire to move its troops through Thai territory. After that Thailand became part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] when Phibun declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration and the United States continued to consider Thailand as an occupied country.) An active and foreign assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as a friendly rather than an enemy nation.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

*'''[[Korean War]]''' (1950–1953)
*: During the United Nations-mandated conflict in the [[Korean peninsula]], Thailand provided the 21st Regiment of about 1,294 men. The Kingdom also provided 4 naval vessels and an air transport unit to the UN command structure. The contingent was actively engaged and suffered heavy casualties, including 139 dead.

*'''[[Vietnam War]]''' (1955–1975)
*: Due to its close proximity with Thailand, [[Vietnam]]'s conflict was closely monitored by Bangkok. Thai involvement did not become official until the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution|total involvement]] of the [[United States]] in 1963. Thailand allowed the [[United States Air Force in Thailand]] to use air bases and naval bases for U.S. forces. Eventually contributing infantry units and other resources. The Thai Armed Forces suffered 1,351 deaths. However, Thailand was more involved with the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]] and covert operations in Laos from 1964 to 1972. By 1975 relations between Bangkok and Washington had soured, and in 1977 President [[James Earl Carter]] withdrew all U.S. military personnel and the bases were closed.

*'''[[Communist Party of Thailand|Communist Insurgency]]''' (1976-1980s)
*: The [[Communist]] victory in Vietnam in 1975 emboldened the Communist movement within Thailand, which has been in existence since the 1920s. After the [[6 October 1976 Massacre|Thammasat University massacre of leftist student demonstrators in 1976]] and the repressive policies of rightwing Prime Minister [[Tanin Kraivixien]], sympathies for the movement increased. By the late seventies it is estimated that the movement had as many as 12,000 armed insurgents,<ref>[http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr55/fthailand1959.htm Thailand Communist Insurgency 1959–Present].

In 1982 Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] issued a general amnesty for all Communist former insurgents.

*'''[[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese border raids]]''' (1979–1988)
*: With the Vietnamese [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|invasion of Cambodia]] in 1978, Communist Vietnam had a combined force of about 300,000 in Laos and Cambodia. This posed a massive potential threat to the Thais, as they could no longer rely on Cambodia to act as a [[buffer state]]. Small encounters occasionally took place when Vietnamese forces crossed into Thailand in pursuit of fleeing [[Khmer Rouge]] troops. However, a full and official conflict was never declared, as neither country wanted it.

*'''[[Thai–Laotian Border War]]''' (1987–1988)
*: This was a small conflict over mountainous territory including three disputed villages on the border between the [[Sainyabuli Province]] in Laos and [[Phitsanulok Province]] in Thailand, whose ownership had been left unclear by the map drawn by the French some 80 years earlier. Caused by then Army commander [[Chavalit Yongchaiydht]] against the wishes of the government, the war ended with a virtual Laos' surrender{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} and return to [[status quo ante bellum]].

===Royal Thai Navy===
{{Main|Royal Thai Navy}}
The navy's combat forces included the Royal Fleet and the Royal Thai Marine Corps. The 130 vessels of the Royal Fleet included frigates equipped with surface-to-air missiles, fast attack craft armed with surface-to-surface missiles, large coastal patrol craft, coastal minelayers, coastal minesweepers, landing craft, and training ships.

The mission spaces of Thailand navy include the Thai Gulf and Indian Ocean, separated by land, and river. Naval affairs were directed by the country's most senior admiral from his Bangkok headquarters. The naval commander in chief was supported by staff groups that planned and administered such activities as logistics, education and training, and various special services. The headquarters general staff functioned like those of corresponding staffs in the army and air force command structures.

==Uniforms, ranks, insignia==
To build institutional solidarity and esprit de corps, each Thai service component has developed its own distinctive uniforms, ranking system, and insignia.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+th0148%29 Thailand]. Lcweb2.loc.gov. Retrieved on 2012-01-18.</ref> Many Thai military uniforms reflect historical foreign influences. For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honor on ceremonial occasions.

[[File:The 1st Artillery Bataillion, King's Guard in the procession of Princess Galyani Vadhana's royal urn.jpg|thumb|260px|The 1st Artillery Battalion, King's Guard in the procession of Princess [[Galyani Vadhana]]'s royal urn]]

The rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorized by the minister of defense. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers—in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000—Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.

Thai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalized. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialized training.

Formal honors and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.
